# Universal message structure
`<command (unsigned 8 bit)><n params (unsigned 8 bit)><parameters...>`

## Parameter
`<type (unsigned 4 bit)<value length (unsigned 16 bit)><value>`

### Parameter type
one of:

- 0 (binary data string);
- 1 (double precision IEEE float);
- 2 (32-bit integer).

# Message types
There are several message types, some bidirectional but most in one direction.

Structure example is in ASCII, the conversion to the real binary format should be trivial.

## Bidirectional

### PING (0)
This message can be send by either side in a self chosen interval.
The other side should respond with a PONG within a maximum set amount of missed PINGs.
Generally this is set to 3, so the other side can miss two PINGs and only then respond with a PONG to reset the miss counter.

Structure:
`PING`

### PONG (1)
The message to reply with a PING, should be sent in response to a PING.

Structure:
`PONG`

## Watch to host

### INCREMENT (2)
An update to the live view on the host.
Should be send every LIVE_INTERVAL.

The time delta is since the previous sent INCREMENT message in milliseconds.

Structure:
`INCREMENT <sensor> <time delta> <data...>`

### PLAYBACK (3)
A data point for the full recorded session.

The time delta is since the start of the recording session in milliseconds.

Structure:
`PLAYBACK <sensor> <time delta> <data...>`

## Host to watch

### SENSOR_INTERVAL (4)
Set the interval for a given sensor in milliseconds.

Structure:
`SENSOR_INTERVAL <sensor> <interval>`

### SENSOR_SETTING (5)
Set a specific sensor dependent setting for the watch.

Structure:
`SENSOR_SETTING <sensor> <setting name> <setting value>`

### LIVE_INTERVAL (6)
Set the interval in milliseconds for sending aggregated updates for the Host's live dashboard.

Structure:
`LIVE_INTERVAL <interval>`

# Example
Accelerometer live view update, 100ms after the previous one.
Values are in order of x,y,z acceleration.

`INCREMENT 5 STRING!accel INTEGER!100 DOUBLE!5.43894 DOUBLE!3.47392 DOUBLE!1.32419`
